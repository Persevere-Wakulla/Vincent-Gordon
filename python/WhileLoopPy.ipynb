    "        Iteration  means executing the same block of code over and over, potentially many times. A programming structure that implements iteration called a loop.\n",

    "        in programming there are two types of iterations indefinite and definite:\n",

    "        Below is an example of basic While Loop Syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "        While <expression>:\n",
    "            <statements(s)>\n",
    "\n",
    "        <statement(s)> represents the block to be repeatedly executed, often referred to as the body of the loop. This is denoted with indentation just as in an if statement. The controlling expression <expression>, typically involves one or more variables that are initialized prior to starting the loop and then modified somewhere in the loop body.\n",
    "\n",
    "        When a while loop is encountered it's first evaluated in Boolean Context. If it is true the loop body is executed. Then its checked again and if its still true the body is executed again. This continues until it becomes false, at which point program execution proceeds to the first statement beyond the loop body."
